### Tropical Deforestation Monitoring

Logging activities are a major ... human impact.. tracking road expansion across indigenous territories indicative of 

The Surface Water Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS) is a gridded global surface water fraction product derived from combined passive-active microwave datasets (SSM/I, SSMIS, ERS, QuikSCAT, ASCAT). Its development was supported by the [Home Depot Illegal Logging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giQQ3S_1HDk)
