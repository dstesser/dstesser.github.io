## Tropical Deforestation Monitoring

Logging activities and agricultural expansion are significant drivers of deforestation in tropical rainforests. I collaborate with conservation organizations to develop satellite imagery products, informed by my fieldwork, to monitor forest degradation activities in near-real time. 

These efforts assist indigenous communities in preserving their territorial integrity against the intrusion of <a href="https://homedepot-deforestation.org/" target="_blank">industrial logging activities</a>. Additionally, they aid <a href="https://www.jocotococonservation.org/" target="_blank">conservation groups</a> in establishing forest conservation corridors in biodiversity hotspots such as the Chocó rainforest of western Ecuador.<br>

## Vegetation Structural Modeling

Detailed information on vegetation structure is a fundamental indicator of functions, including carbon storage. Community biodiversity is dependent on local-scale vegetation structure, which can be complex in tropical and temperate forest ecosystems. 

Lidar technologies adapted from precision survey applications, are able create detailed maps of the three-dimensional structure and form of natural environments at a level of detail not previously available. These observations will bring about major advances in the understanding of tree dominated ecosystems and new ways to quantify biodiversity.

This work demonstrates how quantitative structural tree-models that approximate the size and orientation of tree stems and branches can be used to extract vegetation geometries to define plot-scale plant physiology from lidar observations.
