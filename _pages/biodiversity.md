Fieldwork campaigns are essential for conservation efforts, as they validate habitat capacity and assess ecosystem health. Biological inventories are integral to these campaigns, and I have actively participated in numerous efforts aimed at identifying endemic species. 

The following gallery showcases some of the species documented by my team over several years in the Choc√≥ Hotspot of Biodiversity.

## Habitat Restoration
Habitat restoration is essential for conservation efforts as it counteracts ecosystem degradation, preserves biodiversity, and creates carbon sinks to mitigate climate change. Through my involvement in identifying priority conservation areas and implementing habitat regeneration projects, particularly in tropical forests, we aim to restore critical regions of biodiversity and bolster ecosystem resilience, thereby making substantial contributions to global conservation objectives.

The number of years indicates the approximate amount of time each plot has been naturally regenerating since achieving protected conservation status.
