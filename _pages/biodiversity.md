Fieldwork campaigns are essential for conservation efforts, as they validate habitat capacity and assess ecosystem health. Biological inventories are integral to these campaigns, and I have actively participated in numerous efforts aimed at identifying endemic species. 

The following gallery showcases some of the species documented by my team over several years in the Choc√≥ Hotspot of Biodiversity.

## Habitat Restoration
Habitat restoration is essential for conservation efforts as it counteracts ecosystem degradation, preserves biodiversity, and creates carbon sinks to mitigate climate change. Through my collaborations in identifying priority conservation areas and implementing habitat regeneration projects, particularly in tropical forests, we aim to restore critical regions of biodiversity and bolster ecosystem resilience, thereby making substantial contributions to global conservation objectives.

        <figcaption style="font-size: 15px; max-width: 90%; text-align:left; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: -15px;">(Left) I developed a forest regeneration index, derived from satellite radar imagery, which is sensitive to various tropical forest land cover types and monitors regrowth. I utilize this method to evaluate the regeneration of tropical forest areas within conservation zones. (Right) Utilizing time-series imagery enables the reconstruction of land cover changes spanning over 20 years, aiding in the assessment of conservation priority regions and their potential for forest regeneration, crucial for biodiversity protection and climate change initiatives.</figcaption>

The number of years indicates the amount of time each site has been naturally regenerating since achieving protected conservation status.
