Greetings. Thank you for visiting my personal page. I enjoying working in various roles, including remote sensing scientist, Earth science educator, and mapping enthusiast.

I am a research scientist at the City College of New York developing environmental monitoring capabilities from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and drone imagery. In previous roles, I've worked on:

* Developing machine learning and computer vision algorithms for agricultural monitoring and mapping of regenerative practices at **[Indigo Ag](https://www.indigoag.com/)**
* Regional to global scale mapping of surface water patterns and wetlands classification using a variety of different satellite and aerial remote sensing data, at the **City College of New York** and **NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**
* Flood risk assessments and supply deployment recommendations at the **Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre**
* Assimilating regional weather forecasts and crop yield models at the **International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI)** at Columbia University
