Welcome to my personal page, highlighting some of my research and related endeavors. I have experience working across diverse roles, including remote sensing scientist, biodiversity conservationist, and environmental science educator. 

My research focuses on developing environmental monitoring capabilities from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical/IR, and Lidar imagery acquired by satellites and drones. Some of my projects include:

* Assessing the degradation and recovery of tropical forests to evaluate nature-based climate solutions
* Monitoring crop health and developing agricultural inventories to guide sustainable ESG strategies
* Fusing ecosystem and landcover data from diverse sources to identify priority regions for biodiversity conservation
